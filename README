Django applications :
	algo : It's just an example-testing app to test the way django works,
				its just comparing some algoritms initialized from the inputs/results.xml

	genplot : A  demo of how the final infrastructure going to be. It produces the same result as : http://lhcb-release-area.web.cern.ch/LHCb-release-area/DOC/gauss/generator/validation/index.html
				example output : http://lhcb-release-area.web.cern.ch/LHCb-release-area/DOC/gauss/generator/validation/Gauss_30000000_v39r0_v37r8_Pythia_6.424_6.418/page.html
				
				the database schema for this app is static (to be avoided) 

	
	generic : the same functionality with genplot app but the database schema will be generic(wanted)
				(under construction)

Other folders:
		static : folders to save the static files (images,css files etc), apache will use this folder to serve the static files

		inputs : contains some files which are used as input to provide initial data for the database in order to test the apps

 		templates : contains the templates which the apps return as HttpResponses to the user
		

	(more documentation will come soon with a more stable and representative version of LHCbPR)
