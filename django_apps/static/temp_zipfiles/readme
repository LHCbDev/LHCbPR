this folder is needed for pulling the uploaded results 
from DiracStorageElement, works as a temporary storage for the added zip folders
do not remove it, also if you deploy the LHCbPR porject on an AFS web directory
do not forget to give write access to the afswebserver to this folder:
example: fs sa -dir temp_zipfiles -acl  webserver:afs rlidwk
