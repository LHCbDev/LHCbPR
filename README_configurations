**** Set up apache+ssl+shibboleth+django
	
	If you want to find out more information about Django framework check the official site: https://www.djangoproject.com/
	
	Deploying Django with Apache and mod_wsgi is the recommended way to get Django into production.
	
	1) First make sure you have httpd(apache) installed : rpm -q httpd
		To configure your apache check the official documentation http://httpd.apache.org/docs/ or choose a tutorial or your taste.
		After you finish the configuration add an new entry to the iptables so the firewall will accept incoming connections to currently
		listening port 80. Edit the /etc/sysconfig/iptables and add something like that (for example under the same entry for port 22):
			
			-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
			
			then restart iptables: service iptables restart
		
		now your firewall will allow incoming connections to port 80, you can now test your apache( to start apache: (/sbin/)service httpd start) 
		add an index.html to /var/www/html/ and check if your apache works.  
		
	2)	Next install openssl and mod_ssl (using yum). The apache modules exist in /etc/http/modules (mod_ssl must be there).
		For the ssl you can use (for the beginning) the default certificates or create your own certificates , 
		a nice guide to do that : http://www.flatmtn.com/article/setting-openssl-create-certificates
		Again edit the /etc/sysconfig/iptables and add (like above) :
		
			-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
			
			then restart iptables: service iptables restart
			
		now firewall will allow incoming connections for the ssl 443 port.
		
	3) Now that you have apache+ssl it's time to install mod_wsgi (using yum). Attention! The mod_wsgi must be installed with 
		same python that you will install django , for example if you install django on slc5 using python2.6 (and not using the default python2.4)
		when you install mod_wsgi you must install it with python2.6 (download the correct rpm or install from source) and not by using yum 
		because in slc5 yum uses default python2.4 so your mod_wsgi won't play with django.
		
		For more information you can also check https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/howto/deployment/modwsgi/
		
	4) Install django, the one option is to follow the install instructions https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/install/
		or install django using yum (it exists in epel.repo  make sure you epel repository is enable so you can install django through yum).
		You can check/edit if your epel.repo is enabled in /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo (must have enable=1)
		
		then you can install django: yum install Django (current version from epel.repo is Django 1.3.1 the same version is used for lhcbPR developing)
		Check if you installed django correctly : python -c "import django" (if you don't get an error message then django is correctly installed)
